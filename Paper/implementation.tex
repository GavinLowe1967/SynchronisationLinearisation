\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We have implemented a testing framework (in Scala).  The framework supports
both two-step linearisation and the direct algorithms.  We have used the
framework to implement testers for particular synchronisation
objects\footnote{The implementation is available from
  \url{https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/gavin.lowe/Synchronisation/}.}.
We consider the framework to be straightforward to use: most of the
boilerplate code is encapsulated within the framework; defining a tester for a
new synchronisation object normally takes just a few minutes.  Below, we
concentrate our discussion on the part of the framework using the direct
algorithms.

Figure~\ref{fig:ChanTester} gives a stripped-down tester for a synchronous
channel.  (The full version can be used to test several different
implementations with the same interface, and replaces the numeric constants by
parameters that can be set on the command line.)

    for(i <- 0 until 10)

    case (Send(x), Receive) => SyncChanSpec.sync(x, ()) // £= ((), x)£.

    new BinaryStatelessTester[Op](worker(c), 4, matching)()

    var i = 0; while(i < 5000 && doTest()) i += 1
  }
}

%%%%%%%%%%

The |worker| function defines a worker thread that performs operations on the
channel~|c|.  The function also takes parameters representing the thread's
identity and a log object that logs representations of |send|s and |receive|s.
Here, each worker with an even identity performs 10 |receive|s: the statement
|log(me, c.receive(), Receive)| logs the call, performs the |receive|, and
then logs the return.  Similarly, each worker with an odd identity performs 10
|send|s of random values.  This definition is designed so that an even number
of workers with contiguous identities will not deadlock.

|SyncChanSpec| is the synchronisation specification object from earlier.  The
way executions synchronise is captured by the function |matching|, which is
analogous to the synchronisation abstraction function from
Section~\ref{ssec:spec-variations}.  This is a partial function whose domain
defines which operation executions can synchronise together, and, in that
case, the value each should return: here |send(x)| and |receive()| can
synchronise, giving a result as defined by the synchronisation specification
object.  (Alternatively, the call to |SyncChanSpec.sync| could be in-lined.)

The function |doTest| performs a single test.  This uses a
|BinaryStatelessTester| object from the testing framework, which encapsulates
the search from Section~\ref{sec:binary-heterogeneous}.  Here, the tester runs
4 |worker| threads, and tests the resulting history against |matching|.  If a
non-synchronisation-linearisable history is recorded, it displays this for the
user, indicating the first operation that couldn't be linearised.  The |main|
function runs |doTest| either 5000 times or until an error is found.  The
tester can be adapted to test for synchronisation progressibility by passing a
timeout duration to the |BinaryStatelessTester|.

Other classes of testers are similar.  Details and examples can be found in
the manual~\cite{testing-manual}.  In the case of a stateful specification,
the |matching| function takes the specification object as a parameter, and
also returns the new value of the specification object.  The framework
directly supports two-step linearisation testing for binary synchronisations,
but for other forms of synchronisation, the programmer has to define the
appropriate automaton.

\end{figure}

%%%%%

If a tester finds a history that is not synchronisation linearisable, it
displays it.  For example, Figure~\ref{fig:exchanger-error} gives such a
history for an exchanger.  Here executions~2 and~3 have correctly synchronised
and exchanged their values, 76 and~58.  Execution~1 has received execution~0's
value,~13.  However, execution~0 has received execution~3's value, rather than
execution~1's.  This does not, of course, identify what the bug is; but it does
give some indication as to what has gone wrong, namely that execution~0 has been
delayed and so failed to pick up the correct value. 

Similarly, if a tester finds a failure of synchronisation progressibility, it
displays the history.  Figure~\ref{fig:progress-error} gives an example for a
faulty synchronous channel.  Here executions~0 and 1 have successfully
synchronised.  However, executions~2 and~3 have failed to synchronise when
they should have done.
