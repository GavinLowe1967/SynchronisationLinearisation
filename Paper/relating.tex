\section{Comparing synchronisation linearisation and standard linearisation}
\label{sec:relating}

In this section we describe the relationship between synchronisation
linearisation and standard linearisation.

It is clear that synchronisation linearisation is equivalent to standard
linearisation in the (rather trivial) case that no operations actually
synchronise, so each operation of the synchronisation specification object
corresponds to a single operation of the concurrent object.  Put another way:
standard linearisation is an instance of synchronisation linearisation with
just unary synchronisations.

However, linearisation and synchronisation linearisation are not
equivalent in general.
%% : we show that, given a synchronisation linearisation
%% specification object |SyncSpec|, it is not always possible to find a
%% linearisation specification |Spec| such that for every concurrent
%% history~$h$,\, $h$ is synchronisation linearisable with respect to |SyncSpec|
%% if and only if $h$ is linearisable with respect to |Spec|.
%
For example, consider the synchronous channel from Section~\ref{sec:spec},
where synchronisation linearisation is captured by |SyncChanSpec|.  We show
that there is no corresponding linearisation specification object |Spec|,
i.e.~such that for every concurrent history~$h$,\, $h$ is synchronisation
linearisable with respect to |SyncChanSpec| if and only if $h$ is linearisable
with respect to |Spec|.  Suppose (for a contradiction) otherwise.  Consider
the history
\begin{eqnarray*}
h & = & \seq{ 
  \call.\send^1(3),\, \call.\receive^2(),\, 
  \return.\send^1\::(),\, \return.\receive^2()\::3 }.
\end{eqnarray*}
%
This is synchronisation-linearisable with respect to |SyncChanSpec|.  By the
assumption, it must also be linearisable with respect to~|Spec|; so there must
be a legal history~$h_s$ of~|Spec| such that $h_s$ is a linearisation of~$h$.
Without loss of generality, suppose the |send| in~$h_s$ occurs before
the~|receive|, i.e.
\begin{eqnarray*}
h_s & = & \seq{ \send^1(3)\::(),\, \receive^2()\::3 }.
\end{eqnarray*}
%
But the history
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
h' & = & \seq{ 
  \call.\send^1(3),\, \return.\send^1\::(),\, 
  \call.\receive^2(),\, \return.\receive^2()\::3 }
\end{eqnarray*}
%
is also linearised by~$h_s$, so $h'$ is linearisable with respect to~|Spec|.
But then the assumption would imply that $h'$ is synchronisation linearisable
with respect to~|SyncChanSpec|.  This is clearly false, because the operations
do not overlap.  Hence no such linearisation specification~|Spec| exists.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Two-step linearisation}

We now show that binary heterogeneous synchronisation linearisation
corresponds to a small adaptation of linearisation, where one of the
operations on the synchronisation object corresponds to \emph{two} operations
of the linearisation specification object.  We define below what we mean by
this.  We prove the correspondence in the next subsection.  We generalise to
synchronisations of more than two threads, and to the homogeneous case in
Section~\ref{ssec:relating-variations}.  

Given a synchronisation object with signature
\begin{scala}
class SyncObj{
  def op£\s1£(x£\s1£: A£\s1£): B£\s1£
  def op£\s2£(x£\s2£: A£\s2£): B£\s2£
}
\end{scala}
we will consider a linearisation specification object with signature
%
\begin{scala}
class TwoStepLinSpec{
  def op£\s1£(x£\s1£: A£\s1£): Unit
  def £$\overline{\sm{op}}_1$£(): B£\s1£
  def op£\s2£(x£\s2£: A£\s2£): B£\s2£
}
\end{scala}
%
The idea is that the operation |op|\s1 on |SyncObj| will be linearised by the
composition of the two operations |op|\s1 and $\overline{\sm{op}}_1$ of
|TwoStepLinSpec|; but operation |op|\s2 on |SyncObj| will be linearised by
just the operation |op|\s2 of |TwoStepLinSpec|, as before.  We call such an
object a \emph{two-step linearisation specification object}.  

We describe how to define a two-step linearisation specification object
corresponding to a given synchronisation specification object in the following
subsections.  First, we define our notion of two-step linearisation with
respect to such a two-step linearisation specification object.  In the
definitions below, we describe just the differences from standard
linearisation, to avoid repetition.

We define a history~$h_s$ of such a
two-step specification object much as in
Section~\ref{sec:specification-linearisability}, with the addition that for
each event $\overline{\sm{op}}_1^{i_1}()\::y$ in~$h_s$, we require that there is
an earlier event |op|$_1^{i_1}(x)\::()$ in~$h_s$ with the same execution
identity; other than in this regard, execution identities are not repeated
in~$h_s$.

Let $h$ be a complete concurrent history of a synchronisation object, and let
$h_s$ be a legal history of a two-step specification object.  We say that
$h_s$ \emph{corresponds} to~$h$ if:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item For every $\call.\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x)$ and $\return.\sm{op}_1^{i_1}\::y$
  in $h$,\, $h_s$~contains $\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x)\::()$ and
  $\overline{\sm{op}}_1^{i_1}()\::y$; and vice versa;

\item For every $\call.\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x)$ and $\return.\sm{op}_2^{i_2}\::y$
  in $h$,\, $h_s$~contains $\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x)\::y$; and vice versa.
\end{itemize}
%
We say that $h_s$ is a \emph{two-step linearisation} of~$h$ if there is some
way of interleaving the two histories such that
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Each $\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x)\::()$ and $\overline{\sm{op}}_1^{i_1}()\::y$ occur
  between $\call.\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x)$ and $\return.\sm{op}_1^{i_1}\::y$, in that
  order; 

\item Each $\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x)\::y$ occurs between $\call.\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x)$ and
  $\return.\sm{op}_2^{i_2}\::y$.
\end{itemize}

For example, consider a synchronous channel, with |send| corresponding
to~$\op_1$, and |receive| corresponding to~$\op_2$.  Then the following would
be an interleaving of histories of the channel and a two-step linearisation
specification object.
\[
\seq{\begin{align} 
 \call.\sm{send}^1(3),\; \sm{send}^1(3)\::(),\; 
 \call.\sm{receive}^2(),\; \sm{receive}^2()\::3,\; \\
 \overline{\sm{send}}^1()\::(),\; \return.\sm{send}^1\::(), \;
 \return.\sm{receive}^2\::3 }.
\end{align}
\]
%
%\framebox{timeline to illustrate}
This is represented by the following timeline, where the horizontal lines and
the labels above represent the execution of operations on the channel, and the
``$\cross$''s and the labels below represent the corresponding operations of
the specification object.
%  
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale = 0.9]
\draw[|-|] (0,0) -- node[above] {$\send^1(3)\::()$} (5,0);
\crossAt(1,0){$\send^1(3)\::()$}
\crossAt(4,0){$\overline{\send}^1()\::()$}

\crossAt(3,-1.5){$\receive^2()\::3$}
%\draw(3,-1.5) \X;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The definition of two-step linearisation of a synchronistion object then
follows from this definition of two-step linearisation of complete histories,
analogously to as in Definition~\ref{def:sync-lin-objects}.

%% precisely as in Section~\ref{sec:specification-linearisability}.

\subsection{Proving the relationship}
\label{sec:twoStepLinSpec}

We now prove the relationship between synchronisation linearisation and
two-step linearisation.
%
Consider a synchonisation specification object |Sync|\-|Spec|.  We build a
corresponding two-step linearisation specification object |Two|\-|StepLinSpec|
such that synchronisation linearisation with respect to |Sync|\-|Spec| is
equivalent to two-step linearisation with respect to
|Two|\-|Step|\-|Lin|\-|Spec|.  The definition we choose is not the simplest
possible, but it is convenient for the testing framework we use in
Section~\ref{sec:testing-hacking}.

The definition of |TwoStepLinSpec| is in Figure~\ref{fig:twosteplinspec}.  We
assume that each thread has an identity in some range $\range 0
{\sm{NumThreads}}$.  For simplicity, we arrange for this identity to be
included in the $\call$ events for operations~|op|\s1 and
$\overline{\sm{op}}_1$.
%%  (Alternatively, we
%% could implement thread identities internally to the object, for example using
%% the technique from~\cite[Appendix~A.2.4]{herlihy-shavit}.)

%%%%%

\begin{figure}
\begin{scala}
type ThreadID = Int              // Thread identifiers.
val NumThreads: Int = ...       // Number of threads.
trait State
case object Zero extends State
case class One(t: ThreadID, x£\s1£: A£\s1£) extends State

object TwoStepLinSpec{
  private var state: State = Zero
  private val returns = new Array[Option[B£\s1£]](NumThreads)
  for(t <- 0 until NumThreads) returns(t) = None
  def op£\s1£(t: ThreadID, x£\s1£: A£\s1£): Unit = {
    require(state == Zero && returns(t) == None); state = One(t, x£\s1£); ()
  }
  def op£\s2£(x£\s2£: A£\s2£): B£\s2£ = {
    require(state.isInstanceOf[One]); val One(t, x£\s1£) = state
    val (y£\s1£, y£\s2£) = SyncSpec.sync(x£\s1£, x£\s2£); returns(t) = Some(y£\s1£); state = Zero; y£\s2£
  }
  def £$\overline{\sm{op}}_1$£(t: ThreadID): B£\s1£ = {
    require(state == Zero && returns(t).isInstanceOf[Some[B£\s1£]])
    val Some(y£\s1£) = returns(t); returns(t) = None; y£\s1£
  }
}

},]
The object |TwoStepLinSpec| encodes the automaton on the right.  It requires
that corresponding executions of~|op|\s1 and~|op|\s2 occur consecutively,
which means that corresponding executions of~|op|\s1 and |op|\s2 on the
synchronisation object are linearised successively.  However, it
allows the corresponding $\overline{\sm{op}}_1$ to be later (but before the
next operation execution by the same thread).  
\end{window}

|TwoStepLinSpec| uses an array |returns|, indexed by thread identities, to
record the value that should be returned by an $\overline{\sm{op}}_1$
execution by each thread.  Each execution of $\op_2$ calls |SyncSpec.sync| to
obtain the values that should be returned for synchronisation linearisation;
it writes the value for the corresponding $\overline\op_1$ into |returns|.

%%%%%

Formally, the object |TwoStepLinSpec| defines a set of legal histories, using
events as in the previous subsection.  In particular, in each legal history,
the precondition of each operation is satisfied, so the history indeed
corresponds to the above automaton.
%
The following lemma identifies important properties of those histories.
%% |Two|\-|Step|\-|LinSpec|.  
It follows immediately from the definition.
%
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:TwoStepLinSpec-histories}
Within any legal history of |TwoStepLinSpec|, events $\op_1$ and
$\op_2$ alternate.  Let $\op_1^{i_1}(t,x_1) \:: ()$ and $\op_2^{i_2}(x_2) \::
y_2$ be a consecutive pair of such events.  Then |op|\s2 makes a call
$\sm{SyncSpec.sync}(x_1, x_2)$ obtaining result $(y_1,y_2)$.  The next event
for thread~$t$ (if any) will be $\overline\op_1^{i_1}(t) \:: y_1$; and this
will be later in the history than $\op_2^{i_2}(x_2) \:: y_2$.  Further, the
corresponding history of events $\sm{sync}^{i_1,i_2}(x_1,x_2) \:: (y_1,y_2)$
is a legal history of |SyncSpec|.

Conversely, each history with events ordered in this way will be a legal
history of |TwoStepLinSpec| if  the corresponding history
of events $\sm{sync}^{i_1,i_2}(x_1,x_2) \:: (y_1,y_2)$ is a legal history of
|SyncSpec|.
\end{lemma}

%%%%%

The following proposition reduces synchronisation linearisation to two-step
linearisation.
%
\begin{prop}
\label{prop:two-step-lin}
Let |SyncObj| be a binary heterogeneous synchronisation object, |SyncSpec| a
corresponding synchronisation specification object, and let |TwoStepLinSpec|
be built from |SyncSpec| as above.  Then each history~$h$ of |SyncObj| is
two-step linearisable with respect to |Two|\-|Step|\-|LinSpec| if and only if
it is synchronisation linearisable with respect to |SyncSpec|.  Hence
|SyncObj| is two-step linearisable with respect to |Two|\-|Step|\-|LinSpec| if
and only if it is synchronisation linearisable with respect to |SyncSpec|.
\end{prop}
%%%%%%
\begin{proof}
\textbf{($\implies$).}\quad
%
Let $h$ be a concurrent history of |SyncObj| that is two-step linearisable
with respect to |Two|\-|Step|\-|LinSpec|.  By assumption, there is an
extension $h'$ of~$h$, and a legal history~$h_s$ of |TwoStepLinSpec| such that
$h_s$ is a  two-step linearisation of $h'' = complete(h')$.
%
Build a history~$h_s'$ of |SyncSpec| by replacing each consecutive pair
$\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x_1) \:: ()$,\, $\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x_2) \:: y_2$ in~$h_s$ by
the event $\sm{sync}^{i_1,i_2}(x_1,x_2) \:: (y_1,y_2)$, where $y_1$ is the
value returned by the corresponding~$\overline{\sm{op}}_1^{i_1}()$.
%
This is illustrated by the example timeline below, where $h''$ is represented
by the horizontal lines and the labels above; $h_s$ is represented by the
``$\cross$''s and the labels below; and $h_s'$ is represented by the
``$\bullet$'' and the label below.
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale = 0.8]
\draw[|-|] (0,0) -- node[above] {$\send^1(3)\::()$} (7,0);
\crossAt(1,0){$\send^1(3):()$}
%\draw (1, 0) \X; \draw (1,-0.4) node{$\sm{send}^1(3):()$}; 
\crossAt(6,0){$\overline{\send^1}():()$}
%\draw(6,0) \X; \draw(6,-0.4) node{$\overline{\sm{send}^1}():()$};
%
\draw[|-|] (2,-1.5) -- node[above] {$\receive^2()\::3$} (5,-1.5);
\crossAt(3,-1.5){$\receive^2()\::3$};
%\draw(3,-1.5) \X; \draw(3,-1.9) node{$\sm{receive}^2()\::3$};
%
\draw(3,-2.5) node{$\bullet$}; 
\draw(3,-2.9) node{$\sm{sync}^{1,2}(3,()): ((),3)$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The history~$h_s'$ is legal for |SyncSpec| by
Lemma~\ref{lem:TwoStepLinSpec-histories}.
%
It is possible to interleave $h''$ and~$h_s'$ by placing each event
$\sm{sync}^{i_1,i_2}(x_1,x_2) \:: (y_1,y_2)$ in the same place as the
corresponding event $\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x_2) \:: y_2$ in the interleaving
of~$h''$ and~$h_s$; by construction, this is between
$\call.\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x_1)$ and~$\return.\sm{op}_1^{i_1} \:: y_1$, and
between $\call.\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x_2)$ and~$\return.\sm{op}_2^{i_2} \:: y_2$.
%
Hence $h_s$ is a synchronisation linearisation of~$h''$; and so $h$ is
synchronisation-linearisable.

%%%%%

\textbf{($\Leftarrow$).}\quad
%
Let $h$ be a history of |SyncObj| that is synchronisation linearisable with
respect to |SyncSpec|.  By assumption, there is an extension $h'$ of~$h$, and
a legal history~$h_s$ of |SyncSpec| such that $h_s$ is a synchronisation
linearisation of $h'' = complete(h')$.
%
Build a history~$h_s'$ of |TwoStepLinSpec| by replacing each event
$\sm{sync}^{i_1,i_2}(x_1,x_2) \:: (y_1,y_2)$ in~$h_s$ by the three consecutive
events $\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x_1) \:: ()$,\, $\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x_2) \:: y_2$,\,
$\overline{\sm{op}}_1^{i_1}() \:: y_1$.

The history~$h_s'$ is legal for |TwoStepLinSpec| by
Lemma~\ref{lem:TwoStepLinSpec-histories}.
%
It is possible to interleave $h''$ and~$h_s'$ by placing each triple
$\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x_1) \:: ()$,\, $\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x_2) \:: y_2$,\,
$\overline{\sm{op}}_1^{i_1}() \:: y_1$ in the same place as the corresponding
event $\sm{sync}^{i_1,i_2}(x_1,x_2) \:: (y_1,y_2)$ in the interleaving
of~$h''$ and~$h_s$; by construction, each $\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x_1) \:: ()$ and
$\overline{\sm{op}}_1^{i_1}() \:: y_1$ are between
$\call.\sm{op}_1^{i_1}(x_1)$ and~$\return.\sm{op}_1^{i_1} \:: y_1$; and each
$\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x_2) \:: y_2$ is between $\call.\sm{op}_2^{i_2}(x_2)$
and~$\return.\sm{op}_2^{i_2} \:: y_2$.
%
Hence $h_s$ is a two-step linearisation of $h''$; and so $h$ is
two-step-linearisable.
\end{proof}

The two-step linearisation specification object can often be significantly
simplified from the template definition above.  Here is such a specification
object for a synchronous channel.  (Formally, this is a data refinement,
replacing the variable |state| with the variables |stateIx|, |threadID| and
|value|, and replacing the array |returns| by the array |canReturn|.)
%
\begin{scala}
object SyncChanTwoStepLinSpec{
  private var stateIx = 0            // Takes values 0, 1, cyclically. 
  private var threadID = -1     // Current sender's thread ID when £stateIx£ = 1.
  private var value: A = _       // The current value being sent when £stateIx£ = 1.
  private val canReturn =        // Which senders can return?
    new Array[Boolean](NumThreads) 
  def send(t: ThreadID, x: A): Unit = { 
    require(stateIx == 0 && !canReturn(t)); value = x; threadID = t; stateIx = 1 }
  def receive(u: Unit): A = { 
    require(stateIx == 1); canReturn(threadID) = true; stateIx = 0; value }
  def £$\overline{\send}$£(t: ThreadID): Unit = { 
    require(stateIx == 0 && canReturn(t)); canReturn(t) = false }
}
\end{scala}
